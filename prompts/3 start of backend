I want you to analyze this and cross reference it with the project files we have here, and see what has already been done, and those that haven't been. This is so you have context of what already done and what you need to do. So, create a recommendation if this technical recomendations need to be changed (backend), based on the codebase we have. Do not make changes yet, but put it in an evaluation.md.
