I want to create a outbound engine and this outbound engine is ocomposed of an initial scraper which is an API scraper that I have already identified and that I would like to use in order to scrape my leads then eventually I want you to store these leads inside a Google sheet that has already the columns prepopulated with the same names of what you will find inside a scraper and has on top an additional colum which is called icebreaker column that is gonna be empty when you import the files the first time because you will have to generate later with open AI. Once you stored the data in here, I would like you to start scraping also the website that you find with the data that you're just scraped and I need you to scrape the website for each of the leads that we're going to be resching out and the reason is because we want to use the information of the website in order to produce a so-called personalised icebreaker that we're going to be using in our email marketing campain and once you did that, I want you to add the icebreaker inside the Goggle sheet so that I am able to have everything in one place and ready to be inserted eventually in an email marketing campain to like instantly for example. I would like you to give me a couple of options in which you would like to preceed for me to choose which is the best one. Please ensure that you need to have the following things in mind. It needs to be fast. It needs to be efficeient. You need to be wary of token consumption. The maximum amount of leads that we are going to be scraping is 10 and the reason is because we're running a demo.
