# Skill: ATS Optimization (2025 Standard)

## Goal

Ensure the generated CV passes high-level ATS filters (Taleo, Greenhouse, Workday) and ranks in the top 5% of candidate pools.

## Core Rules

- **Formatting**:
  - Single-column only. No tables, text boxes, or columns.
  - Standard headings (PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION).
  - Clear, linear flow (top-to-bottom).
- **Keyword Integration**:
  - Mirror exact phrasing from the Job Description (JD).
  - Use both full terms and acronyms (e.g., "Human Resources (HR)").
  - Embed keywords naturally within STAR-formatted achievement bullets.
- **Quantification**:
  - Use numbers, percentages, and currencies to demonstrate impact.
  - Start bullets with strong action verbs (e.g., "Led", "Architected", "Optimized").

## Prohibited

- Complex graphics, images, or icons (scrambles parsers).
- Creative section names (e.g., "Where I've Been" instead of "Experience").
- Fabrication of tools, dates, or metrics.
- Tables, diagrams, charts, or any non-textual elements.
