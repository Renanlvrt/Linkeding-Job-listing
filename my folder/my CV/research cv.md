## RESEARCH PROJECT

**Human-Interactive AI Bot for IBM (Human Feedback)** Sep 2025 – Present

- Developed a human modeling framework in VR using IBM Granite LLM, Added 4 artificial intelligence
    SkillsBuild modules with interactive feedback mechanics focusing on human-computer interaction.
- Collaborated with 5 members (AI, game mechanics, UX/design), coordinating requirements with the
    IBM stakeholder and aligning technical decisions through consistent check-ins and clear documentation.

**Integer Partitions (Supervised by Dr. Dan Evans)** Oct 2024 – Dec 2024

- Authored a 12-page research report using combinatorial bijections. Combined combinatorial reasoning
    with visual proof techniques (Young diagrams) to establish partition identities.
- Proved Euler’s Pentagonal Number Theorem to derive a recurrence relation for computing _p_ ( _n_ ) using 2
    generalized pentagonal families, demonstrating proof-based reasoning aligned with theoretical CS.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Biomechanical Sprint Analysis:** Link Jan 2026

- Built a Python-based sprint analysis tool using OpenCV and MediaPipe to extract 33 body landmarks,
    implementing custom algorithms for joint angle calculation and 4-phase sprint detection.
- Applied GenAI prompt engineering to convert computed biomechanics metrics and coach-style feedback
    in focused areas, delivered through Streamlit app with a visualization over 100+ frames.

**Parallel Computing (distributed computing)** Dec 2025 – Jan 2026

- Built a multi-mode threaded client/server messenger supporting broadcast/unicast/group messaging and
    TCP/UDP file transfer. Enforced limits of 1024-byte messages and served 5 queued connections.
- Improved concurrency robustness using thread-safe locks for shared state, input validation (32-char
    usernames), and robust disconnect and crash handling.

**Autonomous Robot Navigation** Jul 2025 – Sept 2025

- Developed ROS2/Gazebo navigation experiments executing 50+ documented trials optimizing sens-
    ing/decision policies.
- Integrated servo motors and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance, achieving continuous 180° envi-
    ronmental scanning through systematic calibration cycles.

## LEADERSHIP & ACTIVITIES

**Vienna Hackathon Finals** Oct 2025 – Present
Led sensor integration strategy for a total artificial heart prototype as part of a 80-member team among
mechanical and electrical engineering. Evaluated accuracy, power and latency trade-offs.

**Track & Field Team Captain** Sep 2025 – Present
Increased athlete engagement by 20% at a top-2 UK sports university achieved through effective leadership
and team coordination by leading a competitive team.
