Dear Selection Committee,

I need to confess something. I was having more fun failing than I ever had succeeding. I
have spent more hours debugging a servo motor than most people spend choosing what
to watch on Netflix. There is a particular silence at 2 AM when you are debugging a
robot, when you stop asking "why did this break?" and start asking "what is this trying to
teach me?" That night, I found the answer. And this letter is my attempt to state it
precisely.

My recent work has highlighted the central question I hope to pursue through AScI: how
can we design intelligent systems that remain robust in the uncertainty of the physical
world? The gap between algorithms that work in simulation and ones that perform
reliably on real hardware is where the most important research challenges emerge.

Prof. Jara Uitto's Massively Parallel Algorithms project (4209) resonates with a failure I
remember vividly. When I built a concurrent messaging system, everything collapsed
under load. I spent days untangling race conditions, watching elegant logic fail at scale.
Prof. Uitto's work on MPC algorithms for graph matchings, building theoretical
foundations for MapReduce and Spark, is exactly the framework I have been reaching
for.

Prof. Antti Oulasvirta's AI Alignment project (2303) connects directly to my work among
a team of 5 on adaptive VR for IBM. We integrated 4 SkillsBuild modules, but the real
challenge was coordinating when all our approaches failed. One teammate wanted
hardcoded responses, another pushed for pure ML. I facilitated the compromise: a
curated database of expert-written responses with AI-driven selection based on user
context. Prof. Oulasvirta's research on combining expert demonstrations with learned
preferences is the rigorous framework for exactly this challenge.

The UniHand project (2309) extends Prof. Oulasvirta's decade of hand tracking research.
My sprint form analysis required a tracking of 33 body landmarks across 100+ frames,
and my first pipeline crashed on all possible edge cases. Rebuilding it taught me that
noisy data is not a bug, it is the starting condition. UniHand's challenge, unified hand
control despite partial observations, is the formalization of what I learned through trial
and error.

I have spent the past years moving between mathematical proofs and physical hardware,
between failed prototypes and the documentation that made the next attempt better.
Aalto is where I want to continue that work, ready to contribute from day one.

Available June to August 2026, full commitment.

Yours faithfully,

Renan Lavirotte
